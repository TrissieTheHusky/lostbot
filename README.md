## How to Self-host

* **Create a file called 'passwords.json'. The path should be: `src/passwords.json`. That file should look like:** ```{ "token": "your-token", "monpass": "mongo atlas password (if using Atlas)"}```\n
* **In the console, do the following** 
```js
npm install
node src/bot.js
```
* **After that, your bot should be online! Its very simple and have fun!**
